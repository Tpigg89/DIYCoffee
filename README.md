Coffee App showing details on coffee and how to make them

The base idea in the begining was to practice a completly progromatic approach and in populating tableviews with data.

The template was to simply present different types of coffee and give a history of each type.
I later added different appliences for making coffee and their history.

I am now looking to add a recipe for each type of coffee and instructions to use each applience.
Then looking to add a section for calculating weight of ground coffee for water depending on amount of people, this is to be able to be adjusted and saved in a list for their own brands they buy.
